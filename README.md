# Phone book written in C

We all heard of writing a program in python to create a phone book. Now this is how a phone book can be done using the C lanuage.

Note that currently it's still in progress since I need to finish up some more functions of the program. For now, it does provide the foundation to the rest of my code.

Ignore the comments in my code for now:)
